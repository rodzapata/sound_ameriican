00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,920
Hello there!

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,620
This is the “Sounds American” channel.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,780
In this video we’re going to talk about
the American vowel sound /i/

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,440
as in the word “be”.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,760
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,100
"each,"

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,180
"see,"

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,380
"key,"

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,220
or "ski."

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,280
Please, note, that we’ll be using a special
phonetic symbol - /i/ - for this sound.

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,380
The /i/ is the third most frequently used
vowel sound in American English,

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,980
so pronouncing it correctly is important for your American accent.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,800
Let’s find out how to make this sound.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,380
To make the /i/ sound,

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,240
you should focus on the correct position of your lips,

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,240
tongue and jaw.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,360
Open your mouth a little,

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,780
stretch your lips as wide as you can,

19
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,780
and make them tense.

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,900
Raise your tongue very high and push it to the front of your mouth.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,000
The tip of your tongue should be lowered just behind your bottom front teeth.

22
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,840
Remember,

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,560
the /i/ is a tense sound,

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,220
so your lips and tongue should be tense.

25
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,260
Your tongue should be at the front of your mouth.

26
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,340
Let’s try saying it:

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,000
/i/

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,660
/i/

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,620
/i/

30
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,120
Now, let’s practice this sound in some words.

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,200
You’ll see a word on the screen and hear its pronunciation.

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,640
Like this:

33
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,600
You’ll have a few seconds to pronounce the word, if you want to.

34
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,660
Let’s begin!

35
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,360
Let's pause for a second and check how you're pronouncing the /i/ sound.

36
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,600
Remember,

37
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,220
your lips should be very tense and stretched as wide as possible.

38
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,680
Let's continue practicing.

39
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,820
You're done!

40
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
Congratulations!

41
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,280
By the way,

42
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,020
did you know that the /i/ sound is represented by the letter 'e' in only 15% of words?

43
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,560
Most often the /i/ is represented by the letter 'y',

44
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,960
as in "city,"

45
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
followed by the letter 'e',

46
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,440
as in "be,"

47
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,660
and lastly by the letter 'i',

48
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,060
as in "ski."

49
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,860
It's also often represented by a combination of letters,

50
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,520
such as 'ea,'

51
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,720
as in "each,"

52
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,820
'ee',

53
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,320
as in "see,"

54
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,540
and 'ie",

55
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,540
as in "piece."

56
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,640
Thanks for watching!

57
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,460
Hope you find it useful!

58
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,140
