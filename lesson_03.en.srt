00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,040
Hello there!

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,000
This is the “Sounds American” channel.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,580
In this video we’re going to talk about the American vowel sound /eɪ/,

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,620
as in the word “make.”

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,140
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,120
“take,”

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:23,980
“day,”

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,160
“wait”

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,980
or “eight.”

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,600
We’ll be using a special phonetic symbol - /eɪ/ - for this sound.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,360
Let's do a quick test.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,380
Read this phrase aloud:

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,180
Every word in this phrase has the /eɪ/ sound.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,060
If you’re not quite sure you made this sound correctly, keep watching.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,460
OK

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,100
To pronounce the /eɪ/ vowel, you should focus on the correct position of your lips and tongue.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,000
Partially open your mouth,

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,020
spread your lips wide and make them tense.

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,040
Raise the middle of your tongue to the roof of your mouth and push it to the front.

20
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,520
The tip of your tongue should be down, just behind your bottom front teeth.

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,640
Remember, the /eɪ/ is a tense sound, so your lips and your tongue should be very tense.

22
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,520
Your jaw should be partially lowered.

23
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,600
Now, let’s pronounce this sound:

24
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,840
/eɪ/

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,280
/eɪ/

26
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,340
/eɪ/

27
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,320
Now, let’s practice this sound in some words.

28
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,040
You’ll see a word on a screen and hear
its pronunciation.

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,220
Like this:

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,160
You’ll have a few seconds to pronounce the
word, if you want to.

31
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,400
[sound prompt to start speaking]

32
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,520
Let’s begin!

33
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,540
You’re done!

34
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,580
Congratulations!

35
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,440
The /eɪ/ is one of the major vowel sounds of American English,

36
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,200
and it’s also the pronunciation of the first letter of the English alphabet.

37
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,380
So, when you hear the /eɪ/ sound, you can assume that it should be spelled with the letter “a.”

38
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,980
And you will be right, but only 73% of the time.

39
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,060
The remaining 27% is divided by the following combination of letters:

40
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,740
such as “ai,” as in “wait,”

41
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,660
“ay,” as in “day,”

42
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,300
“ei,” as in “eight”

43
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,120
or “ea,” as in “break.”

44
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,840
We can’t see a pattern either. :)

45
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,140
Thanks for watching!

46
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,460
Hope you find it useful.

47
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,060
Stay tuned on our Sounds American channel!
