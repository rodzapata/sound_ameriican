Hello there!

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,880
This is the "Sounds American" channel.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,600
In this video we're going to talk about the American vowel sound /oʊ/,

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,740
as in the word "go."

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,140
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,040
"so,"

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:23,980
"snow,"

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,200
"coat,"

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,720
or "though."

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,160
We’ll be using a special phonetic symbol - /oʊ/ - for this sound.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,800
Most non-native English speakers easily distinguish the /oʊ/ sound, but some distort it in speech.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,980
Read this phrase aloud.

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,160
If you feel you may have mispronounced this vowel sound, keep watching to learn how to fix this.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,300
OK.

15
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:13,260
to pronounce the /oʊ/ sound, you should focus on the correct position of your jaw, lips, and tongue.

16
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,520
Round your lips and make them tense, then pull them in a tighter circle.

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,500
Pull your tongue back and tense it.

18
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,160
Remember, the /oʊ/ is a tense sound, so your lips and tongue should be very tense.

19
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,740
Your jaw should be partially lowered.

20
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,360
Let’s try saying it:

21
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,160
/oʊ/

22
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,720
/oʊ/

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,120
/oʊ/

24
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,600
Now, let’s practice this sound in some words.

25
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,900
You’ll see a word on a screen and hear
its pronunciation.

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,480
Like this:

27
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,120
You’ll have a few seconds to pronounce the
word, if you want to.

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,120
[sound prompt to start speaking]

29
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,800
Let’s begin!

30
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,380
You’re done!

31
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,800
Congratulations!

32
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,020
By the way, the /oʊ/ sound is most often represented by the letter 'o,'

33
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,820
so when you hear this sound, you may assume that it should be written with this letter.

34
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,860
More on the spelling:

35
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,840
The /oʊ/ sound is written as the letter 'o' in 80% of cases.

36
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,640
The remaining 20% are split between the following combination of letters:

37
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,440
'ow,' as in the word "snow,"

38
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,080
'oa,' as in the word "coat,"

39
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,480
'ou,' as in the word "though,"

40
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,600
and 'ew,' as in the word "sew."

41
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,740
We, too, like the spelling of the last combination! :).

42
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,380
Thanks for watching!

43
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,100
Hope you find it useful.

44
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,560
Stay tuned on our Sounds American channel!
