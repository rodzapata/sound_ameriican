Hello there!

2
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:07,705
This is the “Sounds American” channel.

3
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:15,334
In this video we're going to talk about the American vowel sound /ʊ/,

4
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:18,459
as in the word "put."

5
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:22,125
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:23,042
"push,"

7
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:24,083
"book,"

8
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,167
"wolf,"

9
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:26,709
or "could."

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,440
We’ll be using a special phonetic symbol - /ʊ/ - for this sound.

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,520
The /ʊ/ sound exists in less than 20% of the world's languages

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,620
that's why people often confuse it with the /u/ sound, as in the word "blue."

13
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:48,656
Let's see if you can distinguish between them

14
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,380
Can you tell the difference?

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,760
If you're not quite sure, let's start with learning how to make the /ʊ/ sound.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,160
OK.

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,560
To pronounce the /ʊ/ sound, you should focus on the correct position of your jaw, lips, and tongue.

18
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:22,300
Slightly open your mouth, round your lips, and relax them.

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,063
Pull your tongue back in your mouth and relax it.

20
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,800
Lift the back of your tongue toward the roof of your mouth.

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,600
Remember, the /ʊ/ is a relaxed sound, so your tongue and lips should be relaxed,

22
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,080
and your tongue should be pulled back.

23
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,900
Now let’s try saying it:

24
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,871
/ʊ/

25
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,040
/ʊ/

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,388
/ʊ/

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,260
Now, let’s practice this sound in some words.

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,700
You’ll see a word on a screen and hear its pronunciation.

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,220
Like this:

30
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:11,281
You’ll have a few seconds to pronounce the word, if you want to.

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,686
[sound prompt to start speaking]

32
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,125
Let’s begin!

33
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,300
You’re done!

34
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,625
Congratulations!

35
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:35,792
By the way, did you know that the /ʊ/ sound is most frequently written as the letter 'u'?

36
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,540
The /ʊ/ sound is represented by the letter 'u,' as in the word "put," in 45% of cases.

37
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:52,920
Almost the same percentage of words with this sound is written as the combination of the letters 'oo,'

38
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,163
as in the word "book."

39
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,480
The remaining 10% are split between the letter 'o,' as in the word "wolf,"

40
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:07,600
and the combination of the letters 'ou,' as in the word "could."

41
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,169
Thanks for watching!

42
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,611
Hope you find it useful.

43
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,683
Stay tuned on our Sounds American channel!
