00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,740
Hello there!

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,820
This is the “Sounds American” channel.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,320
In this video we’re going to talk about
the American vowel sound /u/,

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,440
as in the word “blue”.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,140
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,040
“rule,”

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,080
“too,”

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,160
“do,”

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,720
or “new”.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,160
Please, note that we’ll be using a special phonetic symbol - /u/ - for this sound.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,800
The /u/ sound is not unique to American English,

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,780
but non-native English speakers usually make this sound too relaxed.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,960
Listen to these words:

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,400
If they sound the same to you or if you’re not sure about it, this video might help you.

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,740
Keep watching, and let’s find out how to make this vowel sound.

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:06,720
OK.

17
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,400
To make the /u/ sound, you should focus on the correct position of your jaw, lips, and tongue.

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,980
Open your mouth a little and push your lips out, making a small, tense circle.

19
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,420
Pull your tongue far back in your throat and tense it.

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,120
Raise the back of the tongue toward the roof of your mouth

21
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,380
Remember, the /u/ is a tense sound, so your lips and tongue should be tense.

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,720
Your tongue should be pulled back in your mouth.

23
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,940
Let’s try saying it:

24
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,780
/u/

25
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,320
/u/

26
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,200
/u/

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,060
Now, let’s practice this sound in some words.

28
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,300
You’ll see a word on a screen and hear
its pronunciation.

29
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,380
Like this:

30
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,780
You’ll have a few seconds to pronounce the
word, if you want to.

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,060
[sound prompt to start speaking]

32
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
Let’s begin!

33
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,680
You’re done!

34
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,980
Congratulations!

35
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:35,800
By the way, did you know that the /u/ sound is written as the letter “u” in less than 50% of cases?

36
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,800
More on the spelling:

37
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,540
the /u/ sound is written as the letter “u” in 47% of cases.

38
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,740
It’s also often written as the combination of the letters “oo”

39
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,840
or as the single letter “o,”

40
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,320
as in the words “too” and “do,” respectively.

41
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,260
Sometimes, this vowel sound is represented by the combinations of the letters “ew,”

42
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,400
as in the word “new,” or “ou,” as in the word “soup.”

43
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,680
Thanks for watching!

44
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,340
Hope you find it useful.

45
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,340
