00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:04,720
Hello there!

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,500
This is the "Sounds American" channel.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,600
In this video, we're going to talk about the American vowel sound /ɛ/,

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,800
as in the word "bed."

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,140
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,100
"get,"

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,220
"head,"

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,040
"many,"

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,360
or "friend."

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,160
We'll be using a special phonetic symbol - /ɛ/ - for this sound.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,540
Let's check if you can recognize the /ɛ/ sound.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:46,200
Listen to these words: "bed" and "bad."

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,620
If they sound the same to you or if you're not sure about it, this video might help you.

14
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,560
Keep watching, and let's find out how to make this vowel sound.

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,140
OK.

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,120
To pronounce the /ɛ/ sound, you should focus on the correct position of your tongue and jaw.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:13,320
Partially open your mouth, slightly spread your lips, and relax them.

18
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,120
Push your tongue to the front of your mouth and relax it.

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,660
Raise the middle of your tongue to the roof of your mouth.

20
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,460
The tip of your tongue can be lowered just
behind your bottom front teeth.

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,560
Remember, the /ɛ/ is a relaxed sound, so your tongue and lips should be relaxed.

22
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,920
Your jaw should be partially lowered.

23
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,880
Now, let's try saying it:

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,280
/ɛ/

25
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,980
/ɛ/

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,580
/ɛ/

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,300
Now, let's practice this sound in some words.

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,460
You'll see a word on a screen and hear
its pronunciation.

29
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,960
Like this:

30
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:09,980
[bed]

31
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,980
You'll have a few seconds to pronounce the
word, if you want to.

32
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,740
[sound prompt to start speaking]

33
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,720
Let's begin!

34
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,740
You're done!

35
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,420
Congratulations!

36
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,840
Did you know that the /ɛ/ sound is written as the letter 'e' 92% of the time?

37
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,400
A bit more on the topic of spelling:

38
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,140
usually this sound is written with the letter 'e,' as in "bed."

39
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,780
In the rest of the cases, it can be spelled with the combination of letters "ea,"

40
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,560
as in the word "head;"

41
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,260
and with the letter 'a,' as in the word "many;"

42
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,020
or by a combination of the letters 'ie'

43
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,980
as in the word "friend."

44
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,600
Thanks for watching!

45
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,820
Hope you find this video useful.

46
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,740
