00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello there!

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,040
This is the "Sounds American" channel.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,600
In this video we're going to talk about
the American vowel sound /ɔ/,

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,640
as in the word "on."

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,140
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,040
"off,"

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:23,980
"cause,"

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,160
"all,"

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,720
or "saw."

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,160
We'll be using a special phonetic symbol - /ɔ/ - for this sound.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,920
The /ɔ/ can be hard to reproduce for many people and it often gets mispronounced

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,960
Keep watching to learn how to avoid shortening this vowel and to practice it in words.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,400
Let’s find out how to make this sound.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:53,820
OK.

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,800
To pronounce the /ɔ/ sound, you should focus on the position of your jaw, lips, and tongue.

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,780
Open your mouth as wide as possible,

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,480
and round your lips.

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,500
Flatten your tongue and pull it back.

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,820
Place your tongue very low in your mouth.

20
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,940
The tip of your tongue should be touching the back of your bottom front teeth.

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,860
Remember, the /ɔ/ is a very open sound,

22
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,220
so your jaw should be as open as possible.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,240
Let’s try saying it:

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,020
/ɔ/

25
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,840
/ɔ/

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,120
/ɔ/

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,060
Now, let's practice this sound in some words.

28
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,240
You’ll see a word on a screen and hear
its pronunciation.

29
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,660
Like this:

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,620
You’ll have a few seconds to pronounce the
word, if you want to.

31
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,480
[sound prompt to start speaking]

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,880
Let's begin!

33
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,520
You're done!

34
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,840
Congratulations!

35
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:33,900
By the way, did you know that the /ɔ/ sound is represented by the letter 'o' in only 30% of cases?

36
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,320
More on the spelling:

37
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,060
most often, the /ɔ/ sound is written as the letter 'o,' as in the word "on."

38
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,320
In the rest of the words with this sound, it’s written as the combination of letters

39
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,060
'au,' as in the word "cause,"

40
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,780
as a single letter 'a,' as in the word "water,"

41
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,180
and also as the following combination of letters:

42
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,160
'al,' as in the word "call,"

43
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,080
'aw,' as in the word "saw,"

44
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,340
'ou,' as in the word "thought,"

45
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,560
and 'oa,' as in the word "broad."

46
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,260
Thanks for watching!

47
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,900
Hope you find it useful.
