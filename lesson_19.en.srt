00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,260
Hello there!

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,240
This is the "Sounds American" channel.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,860
In this video, we're going to talk about the American R-colored vowel /ɛr/,

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,640
as in the word "chair."

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,876
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,540
"there"-"bear"-"share" or "marry."

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,709
We'll be using special phonetic symbols — /ɛr/ — for this sound.

8
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:41,709
Let's recap what we've learned in the R-Colored Vowels Overview video:

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,260
The /ɛr/ is one of the seven American R-colored vowel sounds.

10
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,820
The /ɛr/ is an R-colored diphthong

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,300
and it's made by merging the /ɛ/ and the /r/ sounds.

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,440
As with all R-colored vowel sounds,

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,540
the /ɛr/ is often distorted by non-native English speakers.

14
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,740
The spelling for /ɛr/ could be confusing

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,500
as this sound is represented by several different combinations of letters.

16
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,260
Now, let's find out how to pronounce this R-colored vowel.

17
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,320
To make the /ɛr/ sound correctly,

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,480
focus on pronouncing two sounds

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,060
and making a smooth connection between them.

20
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,720
This is how you do that.

21
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,320
Start with making the /ɛ/ sound.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,320
Partially open your mouth,

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,720
slightly spread your lips

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,680
and relax them.

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,520
Now, let's place your tongue in the correct position for the /ɛ/ vowel.

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,240
Push your tongue to the front of your mouth

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,980
and relax it.

28
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,840
Raise the middle of your tongue to the roof of your mouth.

29
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,900
The tip of your tongue can be lowered just behind your bottom front teeth.

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:24,260
Next, connect the /ɛ/ to the /r/ sound with a long gliding movement.

31
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,840
Slightly round your lips.

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,660
Curl back the tip of your tongue.

33
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,000
Now, slightly lower the center of your tongue

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
and raise its back.

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,960
Your tongue should be tensed.

36
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:50,000
Now, let's color the /ɛ/ with the /r/ and blend the two sounds together:

37
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,860
Let's talk about the most typical mistakes that people make when pronouncing the /ɛr/ sound.

38
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,200
Number one.

39
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:15,680
Many non-native English speakers reduce the /r/ sound in the /ɛr/ vowel.

40
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,460
This would be fine in British English,

41
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:24,360
but an American accent requires the /r/ to be pronounced.

42
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,040
So, if you reduce the /r/,

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,700
your American /ɛr/ sound will be distorted

44
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,280
and it may lead to misunderstandings.

45
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,860
Compare:

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,980
Number two.

47
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,640
Some non-native speakers pronounce the /r/ in the /ɛr/,

48
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,220
but they trill it.

49
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,160
Remember,

50
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,720
Americans never trill their R-colored vowel sounds.

51
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,360
Compare:

52
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,940
How do you avoid trilling?

53
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,339
The tip of your tongue should never touch the alveolar ridge

54
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:23,620
when you pronounce the R-colored sounds.

55
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,060
Remember,

56
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,260
both sounds in the R-colored vowels are equally important.

57
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,780
Don't reduce the /r/

58
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,780
and avoid trilling it!

59
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,440
Now, let's practice the /ɛr/ sound in some words.

60
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,560
This is how it works.

61
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,100
You'll see a word on the screen and hear its pronunciation.

62
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,320
Like this.

63
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,320
You'll have a few seconds to pronounce the word.

64
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,800
Make sure you complete this part

65
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,080
and practice as many words as possible.

66
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,020
This is the only way to improve your American accent.

67
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,620
Let's begin!

68
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,000
You're done!

69
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,620
Congratulations!

70
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:29,840
BTW, did you know that the /ɛr/ sound is represented by at least eight (!) combinations of letters?

71
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,700
Take a look:

72
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,880
Most often,

73
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,980
the /ɛr/ sound is represented by 'ar' as in "scare" or "parent."

74
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,220
Less often,

75
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,260
by 'er' as in "very' or "there,"

76
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,800
and 'air' as in "air" or "pair."

77
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,640
There are quite a few words with 'arr'

78
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,080
as in "carrot" or "arrow,"

79
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,780
and 'err'

80
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,900
as in "cherry" or "merry."

81
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,360
In some words

82
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,060
these three combinations are pronounced as /ɛr/:

83
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,340
'ear' as in "wear" or "pear,"

84
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:21,020
'eir' as in the word "their"

85
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,840
and 'ur' as in "bury."

86
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:31,080
While several of these combinations of letters represent the /ɛr/ sound in some words,

87
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,580
they may also represent other R-colored vowels in other words.

88
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,800
We know, it's confusing,

89
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,340
but that's how English works.

BTW, did we say that we like your comments?

92
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,640
A few months ago we got a comment from Lan:

93
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,060
"Thank you for great videos.

94
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,480
Do you want your videos to have Vietnamese subtitles?

95
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,780
I can do that."

96
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,220
Guess what?

97
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,440
We now have subtitles in Vietnamese for the most of our videos.

98
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Thank you, Lan!
