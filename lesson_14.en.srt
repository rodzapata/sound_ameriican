Hello there!

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,800
This is the "Sounds American" channel.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,000
In this video, we're going to talk about the American vowel sound /aʊ/,

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,880
as in the word "cloud."

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,320
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,240
"how" - "now" - "out" or "town."

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,000
We'll be using special phonetic symbols — /aʊ/ — for this sound.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,800
Let's begin with a simple exercise.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,600
Take a look at these two words:

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,620
They differ by their vowel sounds:

11
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,200
the /ɑ/ in "bra"

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,240
and the /aʊ/ in "brow."

13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,160
Now, watch and compare what happens when you pronounce these vowels:

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,000
Do you see a difference in how your tongue and jaw move?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,840
When you pronounce the /ɑ/ sound,

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,180
your tongue and jaw move into one position only.

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,876
So you pronounce just one sound.

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,720
That's why the /ɑ/ is called a "monophthong,"

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,900
which means "a single sound."

20
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,160
However, when you pronounce the /aʊ/ vowel,

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,760
your tongue and jaw move from one position to another.

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,800
The /aʊ/ is called a "diphthong,"

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,800
which means that it's made by merging two single sounds into one.

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,080
That's why your jaw and tongue change their positions

25
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,780
as you make the first sound .

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,000
and then connect it to the second

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,040
There are three diphthongs in American English,

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,160
the /aʊ/, the /ɔɪ/ and the /aɪ/,

29
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:14,080
as in the  words "bow," "boy," and "by."

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,760
We'll cover the /ɔɪ/ and the /aɪ/ in our other videos.

31
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,040
As for the /aʊ/, let's find out how to pronounce this sound.

32
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,000
To make the /aʊ/ diphthong correctly,

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,040
you need to pronounce two sounds

34
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,100
and make a smooth connection between them.

35
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,540
This is how you do that.

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,480
Start with making the /ɑ/ sound.

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,880
Open your mouth as wide as possible.

38
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,680
Relax your lips and allow them to rest in a neutral position.

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,960
Flatten your tongue

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,220
and place it very low in your mouth.

41
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,820
The tip of your tongue should be touching the back of your bottom front teeth.

42
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,340
Next, connect the /ɑ/ to the /ʊ/ sound.

43
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,420
Smoothly move your jaw up,

44
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,680
until your mouth is almost closed.

45
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,460
Then pull the back of your tongue to your throat.

46
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,560
The first sound in a diphthong is typically longer and louder.

47
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,780
So, make sure that you pronounce a nice and full /ɑ/

48
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,580
and then connect it to the /ʊ/.

49
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,040
Now, let's glide from the /ɑ/ to the /ʊ/

50
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,120
and blend the two sounds together:

51
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,540
Let's talk about the most typical mistakes

52
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,780
that people make when pronouncing the /aʊ/ diphthong.

53
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,920
Number 1.

54
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:13,920
Many non-native English speakers reduce the /ʊ/ sound in the /aʊ/.

55
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,019
As a result,

56
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,139
the whole sound gets distorted,

57
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,100
and it may lead to misunderstandings.

58
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,100
Compare:

59
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,240
Number 2.

60
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,360
In words like "town,"

61
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,280
the /aʊ/ is followed by a nasal consonant /n/.

62
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,120
Some people may distort the /aʊ/ by pronouncing it through their nose.

63
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,980
This happens if you pass the air through your nose too early,

64
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,560
before making the /n/ sound.

65
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,800
How do you fix this?

66
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,840
Practice pronouncing words this way:

67
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,680
Remember, both sounds in diphthongs are equally important.

68
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,680
Don't reduce the second sound

69
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,420
and avoid pronouncing your diphthongs through your nose!

70
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,640
Now,

71
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,840
Now, let's practice the /aʊ/ sound in some words.

72
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
This is how the practice works.

73
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,940
You'll see a word on the screen and hear its pronunciation.

74
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,420
Like this.

75
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,240
You'll have a few seconds to pronounce the word.

76
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,940
♪

77
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,480
Don't skip this part

78
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,600
and do your best to practice as many words as possible.

79
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,300
Let's begin!

80
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,980
You're done!

81
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,420
Congratulations!

82
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,660
By the way, did you know that in American English,

83
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,400
there are two different combinations of letters

84
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,960
that are pronounced as the /aʊ/ diphthong?

85
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,140
First is the 'ou' combination,

86
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,300
as in the words "couch" or "loud."

87
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,780
The other is the 'ow,'

88
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,400
as in the words "cow" or "owl"

89
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,060
How awesome is that!
