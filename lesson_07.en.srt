00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,220
Hello there!

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,240
This is the “Sounds American” channel.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,860
In this video we’re going to talk about
the American vowel sound /ʌ/,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,120
as in the word “us”.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,220
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,040
“but,”

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,380
“come,”

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,680
“young,”

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,280
or “flood”.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,420
Please, note that we’ll be using a special phonetic symbol - /ʌ/ - for this sound.

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,320
The vowel /ʌ/ exists in only 5% of the world’s languages.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,780
It’s no wonder that non-native English speakers often distort it or replace it with more familiar sounds.

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,440
This video will help get you acquainted with the /ʌ/ and help you make it the right way.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,080
Let’s find out how to make this sound.

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:57,760
OK.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,600
To make the /ʌ/ sound, you should focus on the correct position of your lips and tongue.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,520
Open your mouth a little, relax your lips, and put them in a neutral position.

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,800
Place your tongue in the middle of your mouth, not too high or too low.

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:30,040
Note that the /ʌ/ vowel sound is used in stressed syllables, but your lips and tongue should not be tense.

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,440
Your tongue should be in the center of your mouth.

21
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,900
Let’s try saying it:

22
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,740
/ʌ/

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,320
/ʌ/

24
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,680
/ʌ/

25
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,560
Now, let’s practice this sound in some words.

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,220
You’ll see a word on a screen and hear
its pronunciation.

27
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,260
Like this:

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,020
You’ll have a few seconds to pronounce the
word, if you want to.

29
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,160
[sound prompt to start speaking]

30
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,880
Let’s begin!

31
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,180
You’re done!

32
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,880
Congratulations!

33
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:24,420
By the way, the letter "u" stands for the /ʌ/ sound in 78% of cases.

34
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,340
More on the spelling:

35
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:34,160
Most often, the /ʌ/ sound is written as the letter “u,” as in the word “but,”

36
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,300
then as the letter “o,” as in the word “come.”

37
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:45,300
Less often it’s represented by the combination of the letters “ou,” as in the word “young,”

38
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,060
and “oo,” as in the word “flood.”

39
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,120
Thanks for watching!

40
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,020
Hope you find it useful.

41
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,240
