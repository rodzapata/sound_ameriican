00:00:03,876 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello there!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,042
This is the "Sounds American" channel.

3
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:15,959
In this video we’re going to talk about the American r-colored vowel /ɚ/,

4
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:19,125
as in the word "after".

5
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:23,083
You can also hear this sound in words like

00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,417

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,292

00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,501
dollar

9
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:28,181
or nature .

10
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:34,667
We’ll be using a special phonetic symbol - /ɚ/ - for this sound.

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,060
In our previous video we began exploring the American r-colored vowels.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,840
Here’s a summary of what we’ve covered:

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,620
In American English,

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,160
any time in any word,

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,200
when you see a vowel followed by the letter 'r'

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,920
in the same syllable,

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,840
you have an r-colored vowel sound.

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,920
The r-colored vowel sound /ɝ/,

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,440
as in the words first,

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,480
burn,

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,440
learn,

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,060
or word

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,580
can be spelled with different vowel letters and the letter ‘r’.

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,459
The /ɝ/ occurs only in stressed syllables.

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,300
But what happens in unstressed syllables?

26
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,980
The r-colored vowel sound /ɝ/ has a weak version,

27
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,580
the /ɚ/ sound ,

28
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,751
which is used in unstressed syllables.

29
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:35,931
Its pronunciation is almost the same as of the tense /ɝ/,

30
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,100
but the /ɚ/ is a relaxed r-colored vowel.

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,940
Some linguists consider them to be the tense

32
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,920
and the weak versions of the same sound.

33
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,160
So, let’s find out how to make the relaxed /ɚ/ sound.

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,540
OK.

35
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,420
Pronunciation of the r-colored vowel /ɚ/

36
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,340
is very similar to the /ɝ/ vowel

37
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,920
or the /r/ consonant.

38
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,760
To make the /ɚ/ sound,

39
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,400
open your mouth a little and leave your lips neutral

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,500
or round them slightly.

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,380
The /ɚ/ is a weak sound,

42
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,500
so your tongue and throat should be relaxed.

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,700
Raise the front of your tongue toward the alveolar ridge

44
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,520
behind your upper front teeth,

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,520
but don’t touch it.

46
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,500
Next: curl back the tip of your tongue.

47
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,540
Now slightly lower the center of your tongue.

48
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,780
and raise its back.

49
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,440
Note, that your tongue should be relaxed.

50
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,440
Remember,

51
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,840
the tip of your tongue should be curled back

52
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,960
and it should never touch the alveolar ridge

53
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,115
Now, let’s try saying it:

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,980
/ɚ/

55
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,420
/ɚ/

56
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,920
/ɚ/

57
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,160
Now, let’s practice the /ɚ/ sound in some words.

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,320
You’ll see a word on the screen and hear its pronunciation.

59
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,400
Like this:

60
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,520
You’ll have a few seconds to pronounce the word.

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,540
♪

62
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,280
Repeat each word after the speaker

63
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,660
and try to copy the pronunciation as much as you can.

64
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,540
Let’s begin.

65
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,180
Let’s pause here for a second

66
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,520
and check on how you're making the /ɚ/ sound.

67
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,400
The tip of your tongue should be curled back

68
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,960
and raised towards the alveolar ridge

69
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,200
behind your upper front teeth.

70
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,700
Your tongue and your throat should be relaxed.

71
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,500
Let’s continue practicing.

72
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,660
You’re done!

73
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,660
Congratulations!

74
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,360
By the way,

75
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
did you know that most of the time,

76
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,320
the /ɚ/ is represented by the combination of letters ‘er’,

77
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,660
as in the words "writer" or "teacher"?

78
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,960
However,

79
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,860
the /ɚ/ can be written with any vowel letter followed by the ‘r’.

80
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,020
And this can be really confusing for non-native speakers.

81
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,540
Here’re some words with the /ɚ/ sound that are often mispronounced:

82
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,900
