00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,960
Hello there!

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,960
This is the "Sounds American" channel.

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,740
In this video, we're going to talk about the American vowel sound /ɔɪ/,

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,880
as in the word "boy."

5
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:22,959
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:28,334
"oil" - "toy" - "coin" or "joy."

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,000
We'll be using special phonetic symbols — /ɔɪ/ — for this sound.

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,880
Let's start with a small test.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,200
Take a look at these two words:

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,940
"jaw" and "joy"

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,260
Did you notice they differ by their vowel sounds?

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,760
The /ɔ/ in "jaw" and the /ɔɪ/ in "joy."

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,560
Now, watch and compare what happens when you pronounce these vowels:

14
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,620
Do you see a difference in how your tongue and jaw move?

15
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,500
When you pronounce the /ɔ/ sound,

16
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,300
your tongue and jaw move into one position only.

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,480
So you pronounce just one sound.

18
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,660
That's why the /ɔ/ is called a "monophthong,"

19
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,420
which means "a single sound."

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,380
However, when you pronounce the /ɔɪ/ vowel,

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,140
your tongue and jaw move from one position to another.

22
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,880
The /ɔɪ/ sound is called a "diphthong,"

23
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,640
which means that it's made by merging two single sounds into one.

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,240
That's why your jaw and tongue change their positions as you make the first sound

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,720
and then connect it to the second.

26
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,300
There are three diphthongs in American English,

27
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,000
the /ɔɪ/, the /aʊ/ and the /aɪ/,

28
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:14,220
as in the  words "boy," "bow," and "by."

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,900
We've covered the /aʊ/ and the /aɪ/ in our other videos.

30
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,420
As for the /ɔɪ/, let's find out how to pronounce this sound.

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,760
To make the /ɔɪ/ diphthong correctly,

32
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,980
focus on pronouncing two sounds

33
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,120
and making a smooth connection between them.

34
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,720
This is how you do that.

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,000
Start with making the /ɔ/ sound.

36
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,960
Open your mouth as wide as possible

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
and round your lips.

38
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,420
Next,

39
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,560
Flatten your tongue

40
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,200
and pull it far back to your throat.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,380
Place it very low in your mouth.

42
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,880
The tip of your tongue should be touching the back of your bottom front teeth.

43
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,900
Next, connect the /ɔ/ to the /ɪ/ sound.

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,240
Smoothly move up your jaw

45
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,660
until your mouth is almost closed.

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,940
Relax your tongue and push it forward.

47
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,140
The first sound in a diphthong is typically longer and louder.

48
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,380
So, make sure that you pronounce a nice and full /ɔ/

49
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,620
and then connect it to the /ɪ/.

50
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,620
Now, let's glide from the /ɔ/ to the /ɪ/

51
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,620
and blend the two sounds together:

52
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,120
Let's talk about the most typical mistake that people make

53
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,940
when pronouncing the /ɔɪ/ diphthong.

54
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,980
Many non-native speakers reduce the /ɪ/ sound in the /ɔɪ/.

55
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,480
As a result, the whole sound gets distorted,

56
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,040
and it may lead to misunderstandings.

57
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,980
Compare:

58
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,000
Remember,

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,360
even though the /ɪ/ is more relaxed

60
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,540
and the shorter part of the diphthong,

61
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,540
you need to pronounce it completely.

62
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,280
Now, let's practice the /ɔɪ/ sound in some words.

63
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,120
This is how the practice works.

64
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,840
You'll see a word on the screen and hear its pronunciation.

65
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,080
Like this.

66
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,120
You'll have a few seconds to pronounce the word.

67
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,880
♪

68
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Make sure you complete this part,

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,920
as this is the only way to learn to speak with an American accent.

70
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,500
Let's begin.

71
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,640
You're done!

72
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Congratulations!

73
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,820
A few words about how this sound is represented in words.

74
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,060
There are two combinations of vowel letters

75
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,340
that are pronounced as the /ɔɪ/ diphthong.

76
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,640
First is the 'oi' combination,

77
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,840
as in the word "coin," or "point."

78
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,160
Second is the 'oy' combination,

79
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,460
as in "boy," or "toy."

80
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,840
There's a third one,

81
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,840
the 'aw'.

82
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,420
We know of only one word in which these letters are pronounced as the /ɔɪ/ sound:

83
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,300
lawyer.

84
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,980
