00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,940
Hello there!

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,080
This is the "Sounds American" channel.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,600
In this video we’re going to talk about
the American vowel sound /ɪ/,

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,360
as in the word "it."

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,840
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,940
"big,"

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,180
"gym,"

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,440
"English,"

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,300
or "image."

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,160
Please, note that we'll be using a special phonetic symbol - /ɪ/ - for this sound.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,600
The /ɪ/ is one of the two most frequent vowel
sounds in American English,

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,100
but it exists in less than 20% of the world languages,

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,360
so many people may distort it or replace it

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,160
with the /i/ sound, as in the word "be."

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,060
Let’s find out how to make this sound.

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,580
OK.

17
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,220
To pronounce the /ɪ/ sound, you should focus on the correct position of your tongue.

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,660
Slightly open your mouth, spread your lips
and relax them.

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,160
Raise your tongue high in your mouth and push
it to the front.

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,020
The tip of your tongue can be lowered just
behind your bottom front teeth.

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,000
Remember,

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,140
the /ɪ/ is a relaxed sound,

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,320
so your tongue and lips should be relaxed,

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,380
and your tongue should be at the front of your mouth.

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,340
Now, let’s try saying it:

26
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,500
/ɪ/

27
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,300
/ɪ/

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,160
/ɪ/

29
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,440
Now, let’s practice this sound in some words.

30
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,460
You’ll see a word on a screen and hear
its pronunciation.

31
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,860
Like this:

32
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,420
You’ll have a few seconds to pronounce the word, if you want to.

33
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,220
Let’s begin!

34
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,060
Let's pause for a moment and review the key points.

35
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,900
Your tongue should be relaxed,

36
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,180
raised high in your mouth

37
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,260
and pushed to the front.

38
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,660
Let's continue practicing.

39
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,300
You’re done!

40
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,220
Congratulations!

41
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,800
By the way,

42
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,240
in most cases the /ɪ/ is written
by the letter 'i',

43
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,660
so spelling words with this sound is fairly easy.

44
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,660
And more on the spelling.

45
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,080
the /ɪ/ is represented by the letter 'i'

46
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,440
in 73% of words with this sound.

47
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,800
Less often it’s written by the letter 'e',

48
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,480
like in the word "English,"

49
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,960
or by the letter 'a',

50
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
like in the word "image,"

51
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
and sometimes by the letter 'y',

52
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,220
like in the word "gym."

53
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,660
Thanks for watching!

54
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,480
Hope you find it useful!

55
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,720
