00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,940
Hello there!

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,340
This is the "Sounds American" channel.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:16,780
In this video, we're going to talk about the American R-colored vowel /ɔr/,

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,540
as in the word "sport."

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,960
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,600
"four"-"orange" - "port" or "sword."

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,709
We'll be using special phonetic symbols — /ɔr/ — for this sound.

8
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:41,709
Let's recap what we've learned in the R-Colored Vowels Overview video:

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,260
The /ɔr/ is one of the seven American R-colored vowel sounds.

10
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,500
The /ɔr/ is an R-colored diphthong…

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,480
and it's made by merging the /ɔ/ and the /r/ sounds.

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,420
As with all R-colored vowel sounds,

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,500
the /ɔr/ is often distorted by non-native English speakers.

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,500
The spelling for /ɔr/ could be confusing

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,740
as this sound is represented by several different combinations of letters.

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,360
Now, let's find out how to pronounce this R-colored vowel.

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,440
To make the /ɔr/ sound correctly,

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,740
focus on pronouncing two sounds

19
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,420
and making a smooth connection between them.

20
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,200
This is how you do that.

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,250
Start with making the /ɔ/ sound.

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,620
Open your mouth as wide as possible,

23
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,720
and round your lips.

24
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,060
Now, let's place your tongue in the correct position for the /ɔ/ vowel.

25
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,140
Flatten your tongue and pull it back.

26
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,180
Place your tongue very low in your mouth.

27
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:15,420
The tip of your tongue should be touching the back of your bottom front teeth.

28
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,720
By the way,

29
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,580
there are some variations

30
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:24,260
in how the vowel in the /ɔr/ sound could be pronounced.

31
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,380
It's okay to place your tongue a little higher in your mouth

32
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,540
and not pull it back as far,

33
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:37,200
making a sound that falls somewhere in between the /oʊ/ and the /ɔ/ vowels.

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,100
For the rest of this video,

35
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,760
we'll stick with the /ɔ/ for the sake of simplicity.

36
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,520
Next,

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:53,920
connect the /ɔ/ to the /r/ sound with a long gliding movement.

38
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,040
Curl back the tip of your tongue.

39
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,480
Now, slightly lower the center of your tongue

40
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,500
and raise its back.

41
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,300
Your tongue should be tensed.

42
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:21,460
Now, let's color the /ɔ/ with the /r/ and blend the two sounds together:

43
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,340
Let's talk about the most typical mistakes that people make

44
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,380
when pronouncing the /ɔr/ sound.

45
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,160
Number one.

46
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:46,500
Many non-native English speakers reduce the /r/ sound in the /ɔr/ vowel.

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,520
This would be fine in British English,

48
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,900
but an American accent requires the /r/ to be pronounced.

49
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,900
So, if you reduce the /r/,

50
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,980
your American /ɔr/ sound will be distorted

51
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,700
and it may lead to misunderstandings.

52
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,560
Compare:

53
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,640
Number two.

54
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:24,240
Some non-native speakers trill the /r/ in /ɔr/.

55
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,820
That's not how Americans pronounce this sound!

56
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:33,540
Remember, Americans never trill their R-colored vowel sounds.

57
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,380
Compare:

58
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,880
How do you avoid trilling?

59
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,260
The tip of your tongue should never touch the alveolar ridge

60
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,740
when you pronounce the R-colored vowel sounds.

61
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,780
Remember, if you want to sound like an American,

62
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,860
don't reduce the /r/ when pronouncing the R-colored vowels

63
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,720
and avoid trilling them.

64
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,220
Now, let's practice the /ɔr/ sound in some words.

65
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,000
This is how we'll do it.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,100
You'll see a word on the screen and hear its pronunciation.

67
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,240
Like this:

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,860
You'll have a few seconds to pronounce the word.

69
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,560
♪

70
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,820
Do your best and practice as many words as possible!

71
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,860
This is the only way to learn to speak with an American accent.

72
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,960
Let's begin!

73
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,780
You're done!

74
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,820
Congratulations!

75
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,600
By the way,

76
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,200
did you know that the /ɔr/ sound

77
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,760
is represented by several combinations of letters?

78
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,540
Take a look:

79
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,760
Most often,

80
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,200
the /ɔr/ sound is represented by 'or'

81
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,640
as in "sport" or "north."

82
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,320
Less often by 'ar'

83
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,480
as in "warm" or "quarter,"

84
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,520
and

85
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,040
'oar' as in "board" or "roar."

86
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,060
There are quite a few words with 'our'

87
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,320
as in "four' or "source,"

88
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,460
and 'oor'

89
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,940
as in "door" or "floor."

90
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,380
And there are a couple of other variants,

91
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,380
like in the words "horrible" and "warranty."

92
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,320
While several of these combinations of letters

93
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,000
represent the /ɔr/ sound in some words,

94
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,520
they may also represent other R-colored vowels in other words.

95
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,560
Yes, it's confusing,

96
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,600
but you're used to it already, aren't you? :)
