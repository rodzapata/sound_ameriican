Hello there!

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,320
This is the “Sounds American” channel.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,400
In this video we’re going to talk about
the American vowel sound /ə/,

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,880
as in the word “ago”.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,220
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,040
“above,”

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,380
“person,”

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,680
“parent,”

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,280
or “action”.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,840
Please, note that we’ll be using a special phonetic symbol - /ə/ - for this sound.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,480
The /ə/ sound is one of the two most frequently used vowel sounds in American English.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,300
In fact, one in every five words has the /ə/ sound.

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,360
If you want to pronounce it like an American, keep watching.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,020
OK.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,760
To pronounce the /ə/ sound, you should focus on relaxing your tongue and lips.

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:08,220
Slightly open your mouth, relax your lips, and leave them in a neutral position.

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,020
Place your tongue in the middle of your mouth and relax it.

18
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:30,040
Remember, the /ə/ sound is very relaxed, so your tongue and lips should be relaxed when you pronounce it.

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,120
Let’s try saying it:

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,700
/ə/

21
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,280
/ə/

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,640
/ə/

23
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,300
Now, let’s practice this sound in some words.

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,280
You’ll see a word on a screen and hear
its pronunciation.

25
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,880
Like this:

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,600
You’ll have a few seconds to pronounce the
word, if you want to.

27
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,960
[sound prompt to start speaking]

28
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,120
Let’s begin!

29
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,000
You’re done!

30
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,860
Congratulations!

31
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:21,940
By the way, did you know that the /ə/ sound is written as the letter “a” in one-third of all cases?

32
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,780
More on the spelling:

33
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,280
Most often, the /ə/ sound is written as the letter “a,” as in the word “above,”

34
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,040
then by the letter “o,” as in the word “today,”

35
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,360
and the letter “e,” as in the word “even.”

36
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,860
Less often it’s represented by a combination of the letters “io,” as in the word “nation”;

37
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,540
the letter “i,” as in the word “pencil”,

38
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,520
and the letter “u,” as in the word “product.”

39
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,400
Thanks for watching!

40
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,780
Hope you find it useful.

41
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,600
