00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,300
Hello there!

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,040
This is the "Sounds American" channel.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,600
In this video we're going to talk about
the American vowel sound /æ/,

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,520
as in the word "cat."

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,140
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,040
"at,"

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:23,980
"half,"

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,160
"man,"

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,720
or "laugh."

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,160
We'll be using a special phonetic symbol - /æ/ - for this sound.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,920
The /æ/ is specific to English, as the majority of languages don’t have this sound.

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,960
That's the reason why many people distort the /æ/ or replace it with other vowels.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,440
Let's learn how to pronounce this sound the right (American) way.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:52,940
OK.

15
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,620
To pronounce the /æ/ sound, you should focus on the correct position of your tongue and jaw.

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,880
Open your mouth as wide as possible,

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,800
slightly spread your lips, and tense them.

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,520
Tense your tongue, flatten it, and push it forward.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,940
Your tongue should be positioned very low in your mouth.

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,600
The tip of your tongue should be touching the back of your bottom front teeth.

21
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,880
Remember, the /æ/ is a very open vowel sound,

22
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,360
so your jaw should be very low and your tongue should be very flat.

23
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,600
Now, let's try saying it:

24
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,980
/æ/

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,100
/æ/

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,000
/æ/

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,340
Now, let's practice this sound in some words.

28
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,120
You'll see a word on a screen and hear
its pronunciation.

29
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,400
Like this:

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,740
You’ll have a few seconds to pronounce the word, if you want to.

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,020
[sound prompt to start speaking]

32
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,340
Let's begin!

33
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,380
You're done!

34
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,820
Congratulations!

35
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,440
By the way, the /æ/ is almost always written as the letter 'a.'

36
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,820
And more on the spelling:

37
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:38,920
the letter 'a' stands for the /æ/ sound, as in the word "cat," in 97% of cases.

38
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,080
The remaining 3% are split between the combination of letters

39
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,900
'al,'  as in the word "half,"

40
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,420
and 'au,' as in the word "laugh."

41
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,720
Thanks for watching!

42
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,580
Hope you find it useful.

43
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,420
