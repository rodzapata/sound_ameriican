00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,040
Hello there!

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,260
This is the "Sounds American" channel.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,800
In this video, we're going to talk about the American R-colored vowel /ɪr/,

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,880
as in the word "hero."

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,880
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,400
"here" - "clear" - "deer" or "zero."

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,720
We'll be using special phonetic symbols — /ɪr/ — for this sound.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,720
Let's recap what we've learned in the R-Colored Vowels Overview video:

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,240
The /ɪr/ is one of the seven American R-colored vowel sounds.

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,040
The /ɪr/ is an R-colored diphthong

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,000
and it's made by merging the /ɪ/ and the /r/ sounds.

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,420
As with all R-colored vowel sounds,

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,540
the /ɪr/ is often distorted by non-native English speakers.

14
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,940
The spelling for /ɪr/ could be confusing

15
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,900
as this sound is represented by several different combinations of letters.

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,240
Now, let's find out how to pronounce this R-colored vowel.

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,600
To make the /ɪr/ sound correctly,

18
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,760
focus on pronouncing two sounds

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,040
and making a smooth connection between them.

20
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,720
This is how you do that.

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,260
Start with making the /ɪ/ sound.

22
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,960
Slightly open your mouth,

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,840
spread your lips

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,500
and relax them.

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,240
By the way,

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,920
there are some variations in how the vowel in the /ɪr/  sound could be pronounced.

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
It's ok to tense your lips

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,960
and make a sound that falls somewhere in between the tense /i/ and the relaxed /ɪ/ vowels.

29
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,180
For the rest of this video

30
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,140
we'll stick with the relaxed /ɪ/ for the sake of simplicity.

31
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,420
Now, let's place your tongue in the correct position for the /ɪ/.

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,060
Raise your tongue high in your mouth

33
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,800
and push it to the front.

34
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,040
The tip of your tongue can be lowered just behind your bottom front teeth.

35
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,500
Next, connect the /ɪ/ to the /r/ sound with a long gliding movement.

36
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,960
Slightly round your lips.

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,740
Curl back the tip of your tongue.

38
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,760
Now, slightly lower the center of your tongue

39
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,380
and raise its back.

40
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,360
Your tongue should be tensed.

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:08,080
Now, let's color the /ɪ/ with the /r/ by blending the two sounds together:

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,280
Let's talk about the most typical mistakes that people make

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,360
when pronouncing the /ɪr/ sound.

44
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,020
Number one.

45
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:33,760
Many non-native English speakers reduce the /r/ sound in the /ɪr/ vowel.

46
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,200
This would be fine in British English,

47
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,620
but an American accent requires the /r/ to be pronounced.

48
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,040
So, if you reduce the /r/,

49
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,960
your American /ɪr/ sound will be distorted

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,480
and it may lead to misunderstandings.

51
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,360
Compare:

52
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
Number two.

53
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,860
Some non-native speakers pronounce the /r/ in the /ɪr/,

54
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,820
but they trill it.

55
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:19,620
Remember, Americans never trill their /r/ or R-colored vowel sounds.

56
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,360
Compare:

57
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,060
How do you avoid trilling?

58
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,300
The tip of your tongue should never touch the alveolar ridge

59
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,760
when you pronounce the R-colored sounds.

60
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
Remember,

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,220
both sounds in R-colored vowels are equally important,

62
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,500
don't reduce the /r/

63
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
and avoid trilling it.

64
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,160
Now, let's practice the /ɪr/ sound in some words.

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,740
This is how we'll do that.

66
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,780
You'll see a word on the screen and hear its pronunciation.

67
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,780
Like this:

68
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,780
You'll have a few seconds to pronounce the word.

69
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,800
♪

70
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,200
Don't skip this part,

71
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,120
and try to go through as many words as possible.

72
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,940
This is how you learn to speak with an American accent.

73
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,940
Let's begin!

74
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,040
You're done!

75
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,660
Congratulations!

76
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,220
BTW,

77
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,880
did you know that the /ɪr/ sound

78
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,380
is represented by at least six combinations of letters?

79
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,940
Take a look:

80
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,240
'er' as in "here," or "zero,"

81
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,040
'ear' as in "dear" or "fear,"

82
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,980
'eer' as in "beer" or "deer."

83
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,440
There are a few words with the 'ier' combination,

84
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,200
as in "pier" or "cashier",

85
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,880
'ir' as in "spirit"

86
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,940
and 'irr', as in "mirror."

87
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:40,960
While these combinations of letters represent the /ɪr/ sound in some words,

88
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,040
they may also represent other R-colored vowels in other words.

89
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,860
As we've said before,

90
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,420
English spelling is never easy.

91
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,060
And with that terrible disappointment,

92
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,720
it's time to wrap up this lesson.

93
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Hope you found it useful.

Like this one:

97
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,120
Damn Son asked us to make a video about the /ɪr/ diphthong

98
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,240
as he couldn't find other videos that would explain this sound.

99
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,160
So, here you go, Son!
