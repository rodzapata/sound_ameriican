00:00:03,876 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello there!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,042
This is the "Sounds American" channel.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,959
In this video we're going to talk about the American r-colored vowel /ɝ/,

4
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:19,125
as in the word "first".

5
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:23,091
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:24,431
"girl,"

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,280
"her,"

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,480
"learn,"

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,834
or "word".

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,680
We'll be using a special phonetic symbol - /ɝ/ - for this sound.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,580
American English is known for its r-colored vowels.

12
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,840
You can't speak like an American

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,640
if you don't know how to pronounce them correctly.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,340
So,

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,140
what exactly are the r-colored vowels?

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,780
Let's take these two words: [fist] [first].

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,740
Their spellings differ by only one letter:

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,520
the letter 'r'.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,740
However,

20
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,740
there's a dramatic difference as to how they're pronounced.

21
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:07,400
Listen: /fɪst/ -  /fɝst/.

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,620
Did you notice that the vowel sounds are different?

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,460
The vowel you hear in the word "fist"

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,460
is the /ɪ/ sound

25
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,700
and the vowel in the word "first"

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,580
is the /ɝ/ sound.

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,520
Let's take a closer look at how the word "first" is spelled.

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,760
See how the consonant 'r' comes after the letter 'i'?

29
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,040
In American English

30
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,620
when the 'r' follows a vowel in the same syllable,

31
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,620
it forms a new sound,

32
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,420
called an r-colored vowel.

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
In the word "first,"

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,660
this r-colored vowel is pronounced as /ɝ/.

35
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:57,440
Note, that the /ɝ/ is not a variation of the /ɪ/ vowel or the /r/ consonant.

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,200
It's a distinct sound of American English.

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,860
Check out a few more pairs of words.

38
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,420
Did you notice what these words have in common?

39
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,900
Despite being spelled with different vowel letters,

40
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,580
these words have the same r-colored vowel sound: /ɝ/.

41
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:44,880
Also, note, that the /ɝ/ is used in stressed syllables ONLY.

42
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,300
What happens in "weak" syllables, like in the word "teacher"?

43
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,360
The /ɝ/ has a "weak" counterpart, the r-colored vowel /ɚ/,

44
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,160
but we'll talk about this sound in our next video.

45
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,180
And now let's focus on how to make the /ɝ/ sound.

46
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,320
OK.

47
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:14,560
Pronunciation of the r-colored vowel /ɝ/ is very similar to the /r/ consonant.

48
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,720
To make the /ɝ/ sound,

49
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,520
open your mouth a little and leave your lips neutral

50
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,780
or round them slightly.

51
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,060
The /ɝ/ is a tense vowel sound,

52
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,340
so your tongue,

53
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,420
mouth

54
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,220
and throat should be tense, when you pronounce it.

55
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,540
Raise the front of your tongue toward the alveolar ridge

56
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,540
behind your upper front teeth,

57
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,540
but don't touch it.

58
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,160
Curl back the tip of your tongue

59
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,440
Now slightly lower the center of your tongue

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,040
and raise its back.

61
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,980
Note that your tongue should be very tense.

62
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,900
Remember,

63
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,300
the tip of your tongue should be curled back

64
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,960
and it should never touch the alveolar ridge

65
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,420
behind your upper front teeth.

66
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,040
Now,

67
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,279
let's try saying it:

68
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,920
/ɝ/

69
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,860
/ɝ/

70
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,960
/ɝ/

71
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,720
Now, let's practice the /ɝ/ sound in some words.

72
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,260
You'll see a word on the screen and hear its pronunciation.

73
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,720
Like this:

74
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,720
You'll have a few seconds to pronounce the word.

75
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,840
♪

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,320
Repeat each word after the speaker

77
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,760
and try to copy the pronunciation as best as you can.

78
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,340
Let's begin!

79
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,220
Let's pause for a second and check on how you are making the /ɝ/ sound.

80
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,800
The tip of your tongue should be curled back

81
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,440
and raised toward the alveolar ridge

82
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,880
behind your upper front teeth.

83
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,860
Your tongue and your throat should be tense.

84
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,760
Let's continue practicing.

85
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,760
You're done!

86
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,980
Congratulations!

87
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,360
Let's summarize what we've covered in this video:

88
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,340
In American English,

89
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,780
any time in any word,

90
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,159
when you see a vowel followed by the letter 'r' in the same syllable,

91
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,620
you have an r-colored vowel sound.

92
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,900
The r-colored vowel sound /ɝ/,

93
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,560
as in the word "first"

94
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,000
or "circle"

95
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,040
occurs only in stressed syllables.

96
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,300
The /ɝ/ has a weak version,

97
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,940
the r-colored vowel /ɚ/,

98
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,180
as in the word "teacher"

99
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,340
or "color"

100
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,440
that is used in unstressed syllables.

101
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,860
By the way,

102
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,220
did you know that the tense /ɝ/ and the weak /ɚ/

103
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,860
are the only r-colored monophthongs?

104
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:27,540
This means, that the /ɝ/ and the /ɚ/ are single distinct sounds.

105
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:33,120
All the other r-colored vowels are diphthongs and there's even a triphthong.

106
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,940
Take a look:

107
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,480
/ɪr/ as in "clear"

108
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,840
/ɛr/ as in "care"

109
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,020
/ɑr/ as in "card"

110
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,680
/ɔr/ as in "corn"

111
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,080
and /aɪr/ as in "fire."

112
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,900
Awesome, isn't it?

113
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,600
We'll talk about these sounds in our next videos!

114
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,640
