00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:58,530
colored diphthong and it's made by
merging the AA and the Ruhr sounds as

8
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:05,379
with all our colored vowel sounds the R
is often distorted by non-native

9
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:12,810
english-speakers the spelling for our
colored vows could be confusing

10
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:22,040
now let's find out how to pronounce this
are colored vowel to make the R sound

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,830
correctly focus on pronouncing two
sounds and making a smooth connection

12
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:36,740
between them this is how you do that
start with making the all sound open

13
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,570
your mouth as wide as possible relax
your lips

14
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:49,590
and allow them to rest in a neutral
position now let's move your tongue into

15
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:58,260
the correct position for the AA vowel
place your tongue very low in the center

16
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,990
of your mouth and make it flat

17
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,300
the tip of your tongue should be
touching the back of your bottom front

18
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,390
teeth

19
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:19,320
next connect the aw to the Ruhr sound
with the long gliding movement

20
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:26,400
slightly round your lips curl back the
tip of your tongue

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,560
now slightly lower the center of your
tongue and raise its back your tongue

22
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,580
should be tensed

23
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:49,060
now let's color the ah with the Ruhr and
blend the two sounds together our

24
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,650
are

25
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,870
are

26
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,340
let's talk about the most typical
mistakes that people make when

27
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:08,880
pronouncing the are sound number one
many non-native English speakers reduce

28
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:17,160
the Brewer sound in the are vowel this
would be fine in British English but an

29
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:24,830
American accent requires the Fuhrer to
be pronounced so if you reduce the Ruhr

30
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:32,240
your American R will be distorted and it
may lead to misunderstandings

31
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:42,260
compare
car car park park

32
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:48,230
you
number two some non-native speakers

33
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:56,810
pronounce the Ruhr in the are but they
trill it remember Americans never trill

34
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,040
there are colored vowel sounds
compare

35
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:12,870
cod car Pollock Park how do you avoid
trilling the tip of your tongue should

36
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:19,220
never touch the alveolar Ridge when you
pronounce the are colored sounds

37
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:29,319
remember if you want to sound like an
American don't reduce the Ruhr when

38
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:34,979
pronouncing the are colored vowels and
avoid trilling them
