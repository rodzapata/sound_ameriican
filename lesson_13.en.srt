00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,220
Hello there!

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,240
This is the "Sounds American" channel.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,020
In this video, we're going to talk about the American vowel sound /aɪ/,

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,860
as in the word "like."

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,980
You can also hear this sound in words like

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,340
"child"- "hi" - "sky" or "height."

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,000
We'll be using special phonetic symbols — /aɪ/ — for this sound.

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,280
Let's start with a small experiment :).

9
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,580
Take a look at these two words:

10
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,220
They differ by their vowel sounds:

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,740
the /ɑ/ in "spa"

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,500
and the /aɪ/ in "spy."

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,520
Now, watch and compare what happens when you pronounce these vowels:

14
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,100
Do you see the difference in how your tongue and jaw move?

15
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,820
When you pronounce the /ɑ/ sound,

16
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,720
your tongue and jaw move into one position only.

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,880
When you pronounce the /aɪ/ vowel,

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,920
they move from one position to another.

19
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,040
The /ɑ/ is what is called a "monophthong,"

20
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,620
which means "a single sound."

21
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,480
So, you pronounce only one sound.

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,180
The /aɪ/, however, is a "diphthong."

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,020
It means that it's made by merging two single sounds into one.

24
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,620
That's why your jaw and tongue change their positions

25
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,320
as you make the first sound

26
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,540
and then connect it to the second.

27
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,320
There are three diphthongs in American English,

28
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,280
the /aɪ/, the /ɔɪ/ and the /aʊ/,

29
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,500
as in the words "by," "boy," and "bow."

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,360
We'll cover the /ɔɪ/ and the /aʊ/ in our future videos.

31
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,420
As for the /aɪ/, let's find out how to pronounce this sound.

32
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,500
To make the /aɪ/ diphthong correctly,

33
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,800
you need to pronounce two sounds and make a smooth connection between them.

34
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,780
This is how you do that.

35
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,860
Start with making the /ɑ/ sound.

36
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,900
Open your mouth as wide as possible.

37
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,260
Relax your lips and allow them to rest in a neutral position.

38
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,260
Flatten your tongue

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,020
and place it very low in your mouth.

40
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,980
The tip of your tongue should be touching the back of your bottom front teeth.

41
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:13,300
Next, connect the /ɑ/ to the /ɪ/ sound.

42
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,480
Smoothly move your jaw up,

43
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,960
until your mouth is almost closed and push your tongue forward,

44
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,000
raising it high in your mouth.

45
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,540
The first sound in a diphthong is typically longer and louder.

46
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,540
So, make sure that you pronounce a nice and full /ɑ/

47
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,100
and then connect it to the /ɪ/.

48
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:47,940
Now, let's glide from the /ɑ/ to the /ɪ/ and blend the two sounds together:

49
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,320
When you pronounce words with the /aɪ/ sound,

50
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,360
try to avoid the most common pronunciation mistake.

51
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:09,360
Many non-native speakers reduce the /ɪ/ sound in the /aɪ/.

52
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,580
As a result, the whole sound gets distorted,

53
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,760
and it may lead to misunderstandings.

54
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
Compare:

55
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,420
Remember,

56
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,580
even though the /ɪ/ is more relaxed

57
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,900
and the shorter part of the diphthong,

58
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,760
you need to pronounce it completely.

59
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,360
Now, let's practice the /aɪ/ sound in some words.

60
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,800
This is how the practice works.

61
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,260
You'll see a word on the screen and hear its pronunciation.

62
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,600
Like this.

63
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,360
You'll have a few seconds to pronounce the word.

64
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,020
Make sure you complete this part,

65
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,460
as this is the only way to learn to speak with an American accent.

66
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,800
Let's begin!

67
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,840
You're done!

68
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,300
Congratulations!

69
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,180
At the beginning of this video,

70
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,020
we said that there are three vowel diphthongs in American English.

71
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,500
You may ask,

72
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,120
what about the vowel sounds /eɪ/ and /oʊ/?

73
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,020
Great question!

74
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,659
There's a debate among linguists,

75
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:43,839
about whether these sounds are "monophthongs" or "diphthongs."

76
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,100
Here's what we think:

77
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,320
The vowels in diphthongs are connected with a long, gliding movement.

78
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,080
On the one hand,

79
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,320
the /eɪ/ and the /oʊ/ sounds are pronounced with similar gliding movements.

80
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,500
So,

81
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,740
they are kind of like diphthongs

82
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,940
and we even represent them with two symbols each.

83
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,260
On the other hand,

84
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,440
this movement with the /eɪ/ and the /oʊ/

85
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,940
is not as noticeable as with the other diphthongs.

86
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,420
So, they are somewhere in between.

87
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,480
We admit, they can be diphthong-ish,

88
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,480
but it'd be more logical to consider them as single vowels.

89
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,820
Let us know in the comments if you have any questions!

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,840
