Hello there!

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,240
This is the Sounds American
channel!

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,580
In this video, we’re going to talk about the American vowel sound /ɑ/

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,680
as in the word “got.”

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:27,580
You can also hear this sound in words like “top,” “want,” “box,” or “wash.”

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,860
We’ll be using a special phonetic symbol — /ɑ/ — for this sound.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,720
The vowel sound /ɑ/ is pretty common around the world,

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,800
however, it's sometimes distorted or
confused with other vowels in American English.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,560
Next we'll tell you how to make this sound properly and provide exercises for practice.

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:59,480
OK, to pronounce the /ɑ/ sound, you should focus on the correct position of your jaw and tongue.

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,520
Open your mouth as wide as possible,

12
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,140
relax your lips and allow them to rest
in a neutral position.

13
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,970
Flatten your tongue and place it very low in your mouth.

14
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,400
Your tongue should be in the center of
your mouth.

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,900
The tip of your tongue should be
touching the back of your bottom front teeth.

16
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:34,440
Remember, the /ɑ/ is a very open sound, so your mouth should be open as wide as possible.

17
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,400
Let's try saying it:

18
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,400
/ɑ/

19
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
/ɑ/

20
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,740
/ɑ/

21
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,020
Now, let’s practice this sound in some words.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,200
You'll see a word on the screen and hear its pronunciation. Like this:

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,340
[aunt]

24
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,140
You'll have a few seconds to pronounce the word, if you want to.

25
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,740
[sound prompt to start speaking]

26
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,740
Let's begin!

27
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,100
You're done! Congratulations!

28
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:23,220
By the way, the /ɑ/ sound is most often written as the letter “o.”

29
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,480
More on the spelling:

30
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,080
the letter “o” stands for the /ɑ/ sound, as in the word “got,” in 87% of cases.

31
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,320
The remaining 13% belong to the letter “a,” as in the word “want.”

32
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:49,780
Sometimes, this sound is written by a combination of the letters “al,” as in the word “calm.”

33
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,680
Thanks for watching!

34
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,600
Hope you find it useful!

35
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,240
